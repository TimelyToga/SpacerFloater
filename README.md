# Spacer Floater 
This is a little game that I've been working on about Space Mining. It is my project larger than a single file in C++. I am doing this to get comfortable with C++ and improve myself as a programmer. 


## Rendering 
I am using the SFML library for basic windowing / sound / graphic support. Maybe planning to upgrade my basic viewer to direct OpenGL rendering in the future.
